<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wired X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market consists of two primary types: direct conversion and indirect conversion detectors. Direct conversion detectors utilize materials that convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, resulting in higher image quality and efficiency. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors first convert X-rays into visible light, which is then transformed into electrical signals. While indirect systems are often more affordable, direct conversion detectors offer superior performance, making them preferable for applications requiring precise imaging and lower radiation doses.</p></p>
