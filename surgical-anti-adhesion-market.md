<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Anti-Adhesion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gels</li><li>Sheets</li><li>Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical anti-adhesion market comprises three main types: gels, sheets, and drugs. Gels are viscous substances applied during surgery to create a barrier between tissues, preventing adhesions. Sheets are pre-formed materials that physically separate tissues and are often made from biocompatible materials. Drugs, typically anti-inflammatory or bioactive substances, aim to reduce adhesion formation at the molecular level. Together, these products are designed to minimize post-surgical complications, improve patient outcomes, and enhance recovery after invasive procedures.</p></p>
