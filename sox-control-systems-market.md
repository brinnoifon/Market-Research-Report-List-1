<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The SOx Control Systems Market comprises two main technologies: Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). SNCR utilizes a reagent, usually urea or ammonia, injected directly into the flue gas to reduce sulfur oxides at high temperatures without catalysts. Conversely, SCR employs a catalyst to enhance the reaction efficiency, allowing for lower operating temperatures and achieving greater SOx reduction rates. Both methods are essential for industries to meet stringent environmental regulations and reduce emissions.</p></p>
